  "text": "MSc Financial Technology | Glasgow Caledonian University\nThe MSc in Financial Technology is designed to prepare you for a career in banking and finance with an emphasis in technologies and data management. In addition to the fundamental skills and knowledge of finance, you will be exposed to leading-edge concepts in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain (cryptocurrencies), and big data analysis among other emerging topics.\nThe curriculum draws on GCU’s expertise in diverse areas of finance including regulation, risk analysis, modelling, and securities and investments within the framework of systems architecture, software development, and data management. The content and teaching strategies are designed to help you gain the essential skills and knowledge to prepare you to grow as a professional within the changing landscape of the banking and finance industry.\nAdvances in technology have brought about radical changes to financial operations, products and services. Key amongst them are activities such as the provision of credit (disintermediation through peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding), payment systems (blockchain technology and digital currencies), investments (algorithmic trading, online stockbroking services), and personal finance (robo-advisory services for individual investors). These innovations depend on secure and efficient communication systems and the processing of large amounts of data via machine learning algorithms.\nThe modules in this course will help you gain an understanding of the evolving nature of financial technologies: impact on financial rules and regulation, analysing and managing financial risk, current and emerging trends in different financial sectors as well as challenges and opportunities to the subject and practice of finance. On an equal basis, the course's modules focus on enhancing your skills and knowledge of software development, artificial intelligence, data visualisation and ethics, putting these into practice to solve real-world problems.\nThis course will enable you to:\nCritically apply concepts of machine learning, neural networks, data science algorithms, advanced exploratory statistics to solve financial problems with applications of computational intelligence.\nEvaluate the latest software development methodologies and apply the appropriate process to the information system needs of banking and financial institutions.\nCritically analyse information collection techniques and analysis methods and manipulate and develop tools and technologies designed for capturing, processing, storing, transferring, analysing, and visualising data for financial applications.\nDevelop a workable knowledge base and skills in areas of current technological development in finance (such as blockchain, distributed ledger technology, cybersecurity, payment systems and so on) as applied to risk analysis and modelling, regulation, compliance, and investment analysis.\nGraduate opportunities\nThrough its competitive strengths in the technologies sector, government support and entrepreneurial and innovative character, firms in the United Kingdom have gained 10% of the global market share in fintech, a sector which is worth more than £11bn a year to the UK. Approximately 76,000 people work in the sector with this number set to grow to more than 105,000 by 2030. Scotland is now home to over 100 fintech companies and the country has been voted the best European place to start a tech business.\nLooking at the broader financial services (FS) workforce in Scotland also provides a steer in relation to aspects such as skills demand within this sector. In 2020, the most in-demand skills within the sector in were commonly digital-based including Java, software engineering, SQL and Python. Digital transformation was also identified within the FS sector as one of the key drivers for skills demand. Digital delivery of services within the sector is expected to result in a need to refocus/upskill sections of the workforce resulting in demand for critical families of skills such as data analytics, software development, business analytics and financial crime.\nThe government’s Kalifa Review of UK Fintech, commissioned by HM Treasury, published its recommendations on how to best support the growth and development of the UK’s fintech sector. One of the key recommendations from the report has potential direct implications on a new master’s course in this field: \"Build a pipeline of fintech talent by supporting fintech scaleups to offer embedded work placements to further education and higher education students and Kickstarters\" and \"...facilitate stronger connections with universities and the fintech ecosystem\" in order to enhance fintech's appeal as a graduate destination and deepen relations between industry and academia.\nMore broadly, in 2019 the UK Government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) published research with the key recommendation to \"Retrain and upskill adults to meet the needs of UK fintech by ensuring access to short courses from high-quality education providers at low cost.\"\nIn terms of specific skills, some of those proposed as being included in the MSc Financial Technology’ at GCU show clear evidence of both current and future demand across the UK generally, with data science and machine learning both forecast to see \"explosive\" growth through to 2023.\nIn October 2020 the World Economic Forum published research on the future of jobs globally to 2025.

  "markdown": "# MSc Financial Technology | Glasgow Caledonian University\n\nThe MSc in Financial Technology is designed to prepare you for a career in banking and finance with an emphasis in technologies and data management. In addition to the fundamental skills and knowledge of finance, you will be exposed to leading-edge concepts in artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain (cryptocurrencies), and big data analysis among other emerging topics.\n\nThe curriculum draws on GCU’s expertise in diverse areas of finance including regulation, risk analysis, modelling, and securities and investments within the framework of systems architecture, software development, and data management. The content and teaching strategies are designed to help you gain the essential skills and knowledge to prepare you to grow as a professional within the changing landscape of the banking and finance industry.\n\nAdvances in technology have brought about radical changes to financial operations, products and services. Key amongst them are activities such as the provision of credit (disintermediation through peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding), payment systems (blockchain technology and digital currencies), investments (algorithmic trading, online stockbroking services), and personal finance (robo-advisory services for individual investors). These innovations depend on secure and efficient communication systems and the processing of large amounts of data via machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe modules in this course will help you gain an understanding of the evolving nature of financial technologies: impact on financial rules and regulation, analysing and managing financial risk, current and emerging trends in different financial sectors as well as challenges and opportunities to the subject and practice of finance. On an equal basis, the course's modules focus on enhancing your skills and knowledge of software development, artificial intelligence, data visualisation and ethics, putting these into practice to solve real-world problems.\n\nThis course will enable you to:\n\n*   Critically apply concepts of machine learning, neural networks, data science algorithms, advanced exploratory statistics to solve financial problems with applications of computational intelligence.\n*   Evaluate the latest software development methodologies and apply the appropriate process to the information system needs of banking and financial institutions.\n*   Critically analyse information collection techniques and analysis methods and manipulate and develop tools and technologies designed for capturing, processing, storing, transferring, analysing, and visualising data for financial applications.\n*   Develop a workable knowledge base and skills in areas of current technological development in finance (such as blockchain, distributed ledger technology, cybersecurity, payment systems and so on) as applied to risk analysis and modelling, regulation, compliance, and investment analysis.\n\n### Graduate opportunities\n\nThrough its competitive strengths in the technologies sector, government support and entrepreneurial and innovative character, firms in the United Kingdom have gained 10% of the global market share in fintech, a sector which is worth more than £11bn a year to the UK. Approximately 76,000 people work in the sector with this number set to grow to more than 105,000 by 2030. Scotland is now home to over 100 fintech companies and the country has been voted the best European place to start a tech business.\n\nLooking at the broader financial services (FS) workforce in Scotland also provides a steer in relation to aspects such as skills demand within this sector. In 2020, the most in-demand skills within the sector in were commonly digital-based including Java, software engineering, SQL and Python. Digital transformation was also identified within the FS sector as one of the key drivers for skills demand. Digital delivery of services within the sector is expected to result in a need to refocus/upskill sections of the workforce resulting in demand for critical families of skills such as data analytics, software development, business analytics and financial crime.\n\nThe government’s Kalifa Review of UK Fintech, commissioned by HM Treasury, published its recommendations on how to best support the growth and development of the UK’s fintech sector. One of the key recommendations from the report has potential direct implications on a new master’s course in this field: \"Build a pipeline of fintech talent by supporting fintech scaleups to offer embedded work placements to further education and higher education students and Kickstarters\" and  \"...facilitate stronger connections with universities and the fintech ecosystem\" in order to enhance fintech's appeal as a graduate destination and deepen relations between industry and academia.\n\nMore broadly, in 2019 the UK Government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) published research with the key recommendation to \"Retrain and upskill adults to meet the needs of UK fintech by ensuring access to short courses from high-quality education providers at low cost.\"\n\nIn terms of specific skills, some of those proposed as being included in the MSc Financial Technology’ at GCU show clear evidence of both current and future demand across the UK generally, with data science and machine learning both forecast to see \"explosive\" growth through to 2023.\n\nIn October 2020 the World Economic Forum published research on the future of jobs globally to 2025. FS job roles expected to see an increase in demand over the 2020–2025 period are most commonly digital-based, while those most likely to become increasingly redundant are administrative and clerical roles. Fintech engineers are also in the top 10 emerging roles.",

With a strong commitment to high quality education and research which supports the communities we serve, we have strong partnerships with employers to ensure our students get the careers they dream of and deserve.\nWith a wide range of professionally accredited courses and links with over 300 industry partners, we have the highest proportion of undergraduate level graduates in highly skilled occupations (83%) compared to other Scottish modern universities - with 91% of our students in employment or further study within fifteen months of graduating (HESA 2023). We are Scotland’s leading provider of Graduate Apprenticeships.\nWe are the top performing modern university in Scotland. This year we rocketed into the top 40 universities in the UK in the highly coveted Guardian University Guide, were ranked the UK’s 2nd top performing modern university in the inaugural Daily Mail guide, and entered the top highly regarded 50 UK universities in the 2024 Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide for the first time. We are the leading University in the UK in key health areas including Radiography, Physiotherapy and Subjects allied to Medicine, and first in the UK for Food Science, with Hospitality, Leisure, Recreation and Tourism ranked second in the UK, and first in Scotland.\nFor environmental sustainability we are the only Scottish university with EcoCampus Platinum accreditation and were ranked second in Scotland for sustainability in the most recent People and Planet league table.\nGlasgow Caledonian is unsurpassed by any other Scottish modern university for the level of research (72%) considered to be world-leading or internationally excellent, our health research is only surpassed by King’s College London for outstanding impact, and 100% of our communications, culture and media research is rated as having an outstanding or very considerable impact (REF2021).\nAn independent economic impact report highlighted that Glasgow Caledonian is a valuable asset to the City of Glasgow, not only bringing economic and employment opportunities, but working to address the deep-rooted economic, social and health inequalities in the city (BiGGAR Economics).\nThe University for the Common Good\nGCU contributes to society in a way that goes beyond the traditional role of a university.

  "text": "New project to help measure the environmental impact of EU space industry | Glasgow Caledonian University\nMon, Sep 9 2024 \nA new project is under way at Glasgow Caledonian University to help the European Commission create guidelines for measuring the environmental impact of products in the EU space industry.\nThese guidelines, known as Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR), will provide a standardised way to evaluate and communicate the environmental performance of space-related products, from manufacturing to end-of-life.\nTo support this initiative, the project, which will be led at Glasgow Caledonian by Dr Andrew Wilson, will also develop and gather Environmental Footprint (EF) compliant datasets. These datasets will provide the necessary information to accurately assess the environmental impact of products, ensuring that the guidelines are based on reliable and relevant data.\nDr Wilson, who is based in the University’s Department of Civil Engineering & Environmental Management, said: “It has been long established that there is no common agreement on sector-specific rules concerning life-cycle assessments for space systems, space projects or space programmes. To this end, the European Commission (DG DEFIS) conducted a preliminary study in 2020 on the environmental impacts of the EU space programme. This study found a need for improved guidance, new datasets and better environmental modelling methods in the industry.”\nThe idea of using the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) approach to measure the environmental impact of space systems was first proposed in 2021 in a research paper titled From Life Cycle Assessment of Space Systems to Environmental Communication and Reporting by a consortium consisting of Dr Andrew Wilson and Dr Keith Baker of Glasgow Caledonian.\nFollowing this, in 2022, the European Commission worked with a group of experts to develop a shared vision and roadmap towards the development of a PEFCR framework for the European space sector. And earlier this year, the project was opened for new bids, and the team was invited to join a consortium to help develop the guidelines.\nDr Wilson said Glasgow Caledonian’s role in the project will be to conduct supporting studies using the first draft of the PEFCR guidelines along with the newly developed environmental datasets.\nHe added: “We will test whether these guidelines can be practically applied to different space products. The results from these studies will help refine and improve the guidelines, leading to the creation of a second draft that better meets the needs of the EU space industry.”",

  "text": "REF2021 | Glasgow Caledonian University\nThe periodic research assessment exercise, the Research Excellence Framework (REF), is used to benchmark research and allocate research funds to universities under the dual support system. In REF2021, research was assessed with respect to the quality of outputs, impact and research environment. In the lead up to submission GCU identified staff with ‘Significant Responsibility for Research’ and, from that, those staff which met the criteria to be classified as ‘Independent Researchers’. Each Higher Education Institution intending to submit to the REF was required to agree with the funders a Code of Practice for how to identify eligible staff. GCU’s approved Code of Practice was developed through consultation with GCU staff.\nIn May 2022 the REF results for 2014-2020 were reported. GCU submitted to nine units of assessment (UoAs) with a sizeable increase of 38% in the number of researchers included compared with REF2014.

  "markdown": "# REF2021 | Glasgow Caledonian University\n\nThe periodic research assessment exercise, the Research Excellence Framework (REF), is used to benchmark research and allocate research funds to universities under the dual support system. In REF2021, research was assessed with respect to the quality of outputs, impact and research environment. In the lead up to submission GCU identified staff with ‘Significant Responsibility for Research’ and, from that, those staff which met the criteria to be classified as ‘Independent Researchers’. Each Higher Education Institution intending to submit to the REF was required to agree with the funders a Code of Practice for how to identify eligible staff. GCU’s approved [Code of Practice](https://edshare.gcu.ac.uk/5333/2/REF2021%20CODE%20OF%20PRACTICE%20FOR%20GCU.pdf) was developed through consultation with GCU staff.\n\nIn May 2022 the REF results for 2014-2020 were reported. GCU submitted to nine units of assessment (UoAs) with a sizeable increase of 38% in the number of researchers included compared with REF2014. The work of 230 staff was reviewed by independent expert panels, alongside information on the University’s research environment and how it supports and develops researchers. The submissions from GCU included over 500 research articles, book chapters and monographs, and 26 case studies showing how internationally recognised research at GCU had delivered real-world impact. Over the period being reviewed, 445 research students had achieved their doctoral degrees and University competitive research income topped £40million.\n\n72% of our University research activity was rated as world leading (4\\*) or internationally excellent (3\\*), meaning GCU was unsurpassed amongst the Scottish post-92 universities for the proportion of our research being at that level (3\\*/4\\*).\n\nIn terms of world-leading research (4\\*), 27% of activity at GCU was assessed as being of this quality.\n\nGCU’s overall research quality as described by the Times Higher Education increased from a grade point average (GPA) of 2.67 in REF2014 to 2.95.\n\nSeven of the nine units of assessment submitted by GCU increased the proportion of activity deemed to be world leading or internationally excellent since the last REF exercise in 2014.\n\n[REF2021 results are summarised in the table below.](#ref2021)\n\n### **UoA3 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy**\n\n*   91% of the University’s health research has been formally classified as world leading or internationally excellent (REF2021)\n*   The outstanding impact of our health research only

UK Meds describes the 15 Platinum-ranked institutions as \"universities with the most accessible health services for students''.\nGlasgow Caledonian is rated 11th in the UK and fourth in Scotland.\nThe survey analysed NHS data to assess the number of GP surgeries, sexual health clinics and pharmacies in the postcodes of each major UK university. Each university was assigned a score for the accessibility of each medical centre type. Each of the top ranked universities also offers wellbeing advisers and student counselling on site, along with online resources.\nUK Meds conducted its analysis in response to a recent study that found that almost 50% of university students say their mental health and wellbeing have declined since the beginning of the academic year. The study's respondents also reported that maintaining their physical health has been a struggle due to rising costs.\nUK Meds says: \"Universities are vital in promoting student health initiatives and ensuring access to healthcare. Their influence extends beyond the campus, significantly impacting the surrounding communities by setting a strong example in health and wellbeing. When looking at the actions taken by the Platinum universities, such as offering wellbeing advisers and student counselling on site, along with online resources, it's clear their initiatives can be replicated at any UK university.\"\nLearn more about the UK Meds survey.",
